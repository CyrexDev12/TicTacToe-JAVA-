This is a TicTacToe game with a GUI interface made that supports multiplayer and as well as an AI player. I made this to further my understanding of algorithms, AI, and game development. 


This is all meant for learning as this was one of my first projects I made. I think it is a great starter project for people looking for a place to start in establishing their skills in game development, and understanding NPC AI logic. 
So please feel free to reference all the code here and make your own versions!
